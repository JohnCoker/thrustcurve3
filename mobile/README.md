# Mobile Application

This directory contains the implementation of the phone/tablet application using
[Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).
The web site itself is responsive, so it works well on smaller devices, but the mobile app has some offline
features which are useful when out at the launch site.

## Getting Started

You need to [install Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/#installing-the-cordova-cli)
first to get the `corodva` command line utility.

Then add the two platforms:
```
cordova platform add ios
cordova platform add android
```
