# Mobile Application

This directory contains the implementation of the phone/tablet application using
[Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).
The web site itself is responsive, so it works well on smaller devices, but the mobile app has some offline
features which are useful when out at the launch site.

## Getting Started

You need to [install Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/#installing-the-cordova-cli)
first to get the `corodva` command line utility.

Then add the two platforms:
```
cordova platform add ios
cordova platform add android
```

## Status

This was originally written in 2015 and no longer works with the current version of Cordova.

In 2025 the existing apps were removed from the stores in the face of "app store accountability" legislation.
