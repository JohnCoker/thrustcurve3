# ThrustCurve Rendering

This directory contains various code for rendering data graphs.

## Graphs

The __graphs__ module builds chart images for thrust curves and simulation results.

## SVG

The __svg__ module draws scalable vector graphics images.
It takes inspiration from the HTML5 canvas, although it only implements what is needed for rendering graphs.
