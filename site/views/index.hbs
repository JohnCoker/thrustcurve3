<p>
Here you will find manufacturer specs, certified performance data and other info on commercial model rocket motors and high-power rocket motors. Most importantly, you can download thrust curves for use with rocket flight simulators
(RockSim and OpenRocket among others).
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/info/certification.html">certification organizations</a>
test commercial rocket motors and certify them for hobby rocketry use.
This site organizes data on those rocket motors and provides a place for hobbyists to post their simulator files
and download those posted by others.
With well over a thousand data files contributed by many users, you've come to the right place for rocket motor data.

This site is supported and maintained by
<a mailto:john@jcsw.com">John Coker</a>
in the hope that it will be a valued resource for the rocketry community.
I want to thank the motor testing organizations for their invaluable services to the rocketry hobby
and the hobbyists who create motor data and make it available to all.
See the <a href="/info/contribute.html">contribute page</a> for how you can help.
