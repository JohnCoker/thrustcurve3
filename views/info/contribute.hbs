<H2>Making Motor Files</H2>

<p>
If you can't find data for a motor you need anywhere, you can easily make it yourself.
This page describes creating data for a motor in the RASP format since that has become
most common for interchange.
Here are two examples:
the <a href="#RV_F32">Rocketvision F32</a>
and the <a href="#PP_J140">Propulsion Polymers J140</a>.
For more information, see the <a href="raspformat.shtml">RASP Format page</a>.
(Sadly, both of these manufacturers no longer exist, but the examples are still good.)
</p>

<p>
This page tells you how to make RASP files by hand.
There is also a tool you can use to trace the thrust curve from a graph image
and produce RASP data files automatically.
See the <a href="/info/tctracer.html">TCtracer</a> page for more info.
There's even a video to show just how easy it is to make a data file.
</p>


<A NAME="RV_F32"></a>
<h3>Rocketvision F32</h3>

<p>
First of all, we look at the 
<a href="http://nar.org/SandT/pdf/RocketVision/F32.pdf" TARGET=_blank>NAR data sheet</a>
to find out the information for the header line.
We need values for at least the dimensions, total weight and propellant weight.
(For details, see the <a href="/info/raspformat.html">RASP Format page</a>.)
</p>

</pre>

<p>
Now the more interesting part, extracting the sample data points.
First all of all, we need to find a good quality graph of the thrust
during the motor burn.
This can be obtained from the manufacturer or from the testing organization.
In this case, there are nice graphs on the NAR data sheets.
</p>

<p>
We need to pick inflection points on the graph to enter as sample data points.
The key is to find points between which the curve is a relatively straight line.
If the curves goes up and down above that line, it's still OK.
The goal is to get a simple set of points that bounds the same area and has
roughly the same shape as the graph.
</p>

<p class="img">
<img width="500" height="210" src="/images/info/contribute/RVF32anim.gif">
</p>

<p>
Note that this thrust curve is relatively simple and we were able to capture it
well with only seven data points.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we need to transcribe the data points from the graph into the file as
pairs of numbers.
(Note that we can use the defined burn time from the data sheet to locate the final point.)
And here is the complete RASP file:
</p>

<pre>
; Rocketvision F32
; from NAR data sheet updated 11/2000
; created by John Coker 5/2006
F32 24 124 5-10-15 .0377 .0695 RV
   0.01 50
   0.05 56
   0.10 48
   2.00 24
   2.20 19
   2.45  5
   2.72  0
</pre>

<p>
Here is the graph generated by this site when the file was contributed and we
can easily verify that the data we entered is a good fit to the motor.
</p>

<p class="img">

</p>

<p>
<p>
And there you have it!
Making your own data really isn't that hard and it allows you to simulate a flight
using a motor previously unavailable.
Plus, if you contribute it to this site, it'll be available for others to use as well.

<h3>Propulsion Polymers J140</h3>

<p>
From the
<a href="http://www.canadianrocketry.org/mcc_motor.php?motor=664NS-J140" TARGET=_BLANK>CAR data sheet</a>
we create the header.
The only thing to note is that the data sheet doesn't list the propellant weight explicitly,
but we can easily calculate it by subtracting the burnout weight from the total weight
(Loaded Weight).
</p>

<pre>
; Propulsion Polymers 664NS-J140
; from CAR data sheet
; created by John Coker 5/2006
J140 38 881 P 0.626 1.166 PP
</pre>

<p>
(The graph is a little hard to read on the web, but CAR provides a PDF version which
can be printed for much easier reading.)
Now let's take a look at the thrust curve from the CAR graph:
</p>

<p class="img">
<img width="570" height="348" src="/images/info/contribute/PPJ140graph.gif">
</p>

<p>
Right away, we can see that this is raw data from a single firing,
not an averaged and smoothed "representative thrust curve."
That's OK; we just have a little more work to do.
First of all, we don't need to capture every peak and valley,
especially since the exact shape of the curve would be different for every motor tested.
That's good because 32 data points wouldn't be nearly enough to capture all the detail
of this graph.
</p>

<p>
The second thing we notice is that the thrust curve is chopped off where the thrust
drops below 5% of the maximum.
The data sheet indicated burn time of 4.92s does not include the long tail-off
of thrust that we see in the graph.
So now we have to choose between trying to match the graph or the printed specs.
Let's compromise and put the ending zero thrust point a tiny bit after
where the graph cuts off (say at 5.0s).
</p>

<p>
Again we pick points, this time it takes 13 samples to even get close to the printed graph:
</p>

<p class="img">
<img width="570" height="348" src="/images/info/contribute/PPJ140anim.gif">
</p>

<p>
Finally, we need to transcribe these points for the data.
Watch out though; the graph shows thrust in pounds of force and we need Newtons
for the data file.
It's easy to convert since 1<b>lbf</b> = 4.45<b>N</b>.
(Actually, it's more like 4.44822N, but that's way more precision than this process supports.)
</p>

<p>
So, we just multiply each thrust number by 4.45 when transcribing it:
</p>

<style type="text/css">
table.calculations {
  margin-left: 3em;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}
table.calculations th {
  text-align: left;
  padding-right: 1em;
}
table.calculations td {
  padding-right: 0.5em;
}
table.calculations td:nth-child(2) {
  text-align: right;
}
table.calculations td:nth-child(3):before {
  content: "Ã— "
}
table.calculations td:nth-child(4):before {
  content: "= "
} 
</style>
<table class="calculations">
 <tr><th>Time</th><th colspan="3">Thrust Calculation</th></tr>
 <tr><td>0.02</td><td>56</td><td>4.45</td><td>249.2</td></tr>
 <tr><td>0.20</td><td>72</td><td>4.45</td><td>320.4</td></tr>
 <tr><td>0.25</td><td>54</td><td>4.45</td><td>240.3</td></tr>
 <tr><td>0.30</td><td>53</td><td>4.45</td><td>235.85</td></tr>
 <tr><td>0.35</td><td>43</td><td>4.45</td><td>191.35</td></tr>
 <tr><td>0.45</td><td>53</td><td>4.45</td><td>235.85</td></tr>
 <tr><td>1.15</td><td>50</td><td>4.45</td><td>222.5</td></tr>
 <tr><td>1.60</td><td>40</td><td>4.45</td><td>178</td></tr>
 <tr><td>3.05</td><td>37</td><td>4.45</td><td>164.65</td></tr>
 <tr><td>3.40</td><td>23</td><td>4.45</td><td>102.35</td></tr>
 <tr><td>4.25</td><td>10</td><td>4.45</td><td>44.50</td></tr>
 <tr><td>4.95</td><td> 5</td><td>4.45</td><td>22.25</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Finally, we're ready to add the sample values to the RASP data file!
Here they're rounded off since there's not that much precision in this process anyway.
</p>

<p>
And there you have it.
This motor was a little more tricky, but by carefully picking the points,
we can have confidence that it is a good representation of the burn.
</p>

<a name="accuracy"></a>
<h3>File Accuracy</h3>

<p>
It's important to note that motors vary from firing to firing.
The NFPA standards only require that production motors be roughly consistent.
See the <a href="certification.shtml#nfpa">Certification page</a> for more info.
</p>

<p>
A "representative thrust curve" is formed by averaging multiple firings
and smoothing the curve.
The advantage of doing this is that variances between motors are reduced and the
curve is a better approximation of a typical motor.
But in the end a representative thrust curve or data from a single firing are
both fine for our purposes,
especially given the inherent inaccuracy of the transcription process.
</p>

<p>
After uploading your file (or when viewing anyone else's file), you can
compare its statistics to the certified values on the motor file page.
At the top right is a comparison table; here is the one for the RV F32 example above
(with the total impulse row highlighted):

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-2">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Max. Thrust</th>
          <td>56.0N</td>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<p>
Note that none of the statistics are exactly the same, but I got within 2.7% of the total impulse
which is close enough given the variation between motors.
